# reinfrocment-learning-agents
This is a python based simulation for single reinforcement learning agents supporting:

    - Q learning 
    - Q-Landa Learning
    - Sarasa Learning
    - ADP Learning
    - TD Learning
    - TD-Landa Learning
    
    
Requierments: 

    -Python 2.7
    -Numpy
    -Matplotlib
    
    
Usage:

    Open Agent.py file and create an instance from Agent class:
          agent = Agent()
    then call each of your desired learning method for example for Q learning
          agent.qlearn(iteration, gama)
